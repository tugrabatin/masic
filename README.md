Military aircraft satellite imagery classification
VGG16 pre-trained complex deep learning model was used.
Aircraft images from MTARSI (Muti-type Aircraft of Remote Sensing Images, https://zenodo.org/record/3464319#.YUiSrrgzaUk) were used as the dataset, but the dataset size was reduced and the images were rearranged for training purposes.
MTARSI images are remote sensing images obtained from satellite images usually available on the internet.
